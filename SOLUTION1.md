	Most of the trickiness came from the fact that the specification was only 1 page, and not >10pages. There were several details we decided on our own, some in some jest ("true" and "false" are not case-sensitive in our language). Making ternary operators right-associative was hard (fixed with a simple bit of antlr--`<assoc=right>` just works). 
	Somehow, we did not run into any major issues with anything related to for loops and arrays--we tested extensively, and found no problems. We did run into an issue with decrement tokenizing strangely--by my reading, `x--y` should be legal (and interpreted as the same as `x - (-y)`) but antlr would tokenize `--` as the decrement symbol. We fixed this by not requiring the `-`'s in decrement to be consecutive re: whitespace--our rule is something like `expr SUB SUB ';'`.
	As far as testing, our process was this: I would generate snippets of code that I thought were strange, Windsor would determine the intended behavior by hand and I would verify, and then we would add them to our unit tests. The intention was to have at least one 'proper', 'improper', and 'complex' example for each of the syntactic elements added. 

	I enjoyed this portion of the assignment. -Nick
